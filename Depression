<h2>Small Solutions to Help:</h2>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>Take on responsibilities. When you’re depressed, you may want to pull back from life and give up your responsibilities at home and at work. Don't. Staying involved and having daily responsibilities can help you maintain a lifestyle that can help counter depression. They ground you and give you a sense of accomplishment.
</li>
<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
  <li>If you're not up to full-time school or work, that’s fine. Think about part-time. If that seems like too much, consider volunteer work.
</li>
</ul> 

  <li>Challenge negative thoughts. In your fight against depression, a lot of the work is mental -- changing how you think. When you're depressed, you leap to the worst possible conclusions. The next time you're feeling terrible about yourself, use logic as a natural depression treatment. You might feel like no one likes you, but is there real evidence for that? You might feel like the most worthless person on the planet, but is that really likely? It takes practice, but in time you can beat back those negative thoughts before they get out of control.
</li>

  <li>Get in a routine. If you’re depressed, you need a routine. Depression can strip away the structure from your life. One day melts into the next. Setting a gentle daily schedule can help you get back on track.
</li>

  <li>Set goals. When you're depressed, you may feel like you can't accomplish anything. That makes you feel worse about yourself. To push back, set daily goals for yourself.
</li>
<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
  <li>Start off which small goals that are easily accomplishable 
</li>
  <li>Over time when you gain more confidence in your motivation you may add more challenging goals
</li>
</ul>  

  <li>Exercise. It temporarily boosts feel-good chemicals called endorphins. It may also have long-term benefits for people with depression. Regular exercise seems to encourage the brain to rewire itself in positive ways. Even just walking a few times a week can help.
</li>

  <li>Eat healthy. There is no magic diet that fixes depression. It's a good idea to watch what you eat, though. If depression tends to make you overeat, getting in control of your eating will help you feel better.
</li>

  <li>Get enough sleep. Depression can make it hard to get enough shut-eye, and too little sleep can make depression worse.
</li>
<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
  <li>Start by making some changes to your lifestyle. Go to bed and get up at the same time every day. Try not to nap. Take all the distractions out of your bedroom -- no computer and no TV. In time, you may find your sleep improves.
</li>
</ul>  

  <li>Do something new. When you’re depressed, you’re in a rut. Push yourself to do something different. Go to a museum. Pick up a used book and read it on a park bench. Volunteer at a soup kitchen. Take a language class.
</li>
<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
  <li>"When we challenge ourselves to do something different, there are chemical changes in the brain," Doctor Cook says. "Trying something new alters the levels of [the brain chemical] dopamine, which is associated with pleasure, enjoyment, and learning."
</li>
</ul>  

  <li>Try to have fun. If you’re depressed, make time for things you enjoy. What if nothing seems fun anymore? "That's just a symptom of depression," Cook says. You have to keep trying anyway.
</li>
<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
  <li>As strange as it might sound, you have to work at having fun. Plan things you used to enjoy, even if they feel like a chore. Keep going to the movies. Keep going out with friends for dinner.
</li>
  <li>When you're depressed, you can lose the knack for enjoying life. You have to relearn how to do it. In time, fun things really will feel fun again.
</li>
</ul>
